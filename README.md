Project Overview
Semantic segmentation is a process in computer vision where each pixel in an image is classified into a specific category. Unlike image classification, which assigns a single label to an entire image, semantic segmentation provides a detailed, pixel-level understanding of the scene. This project focuses on implementing semantic segmentation using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

Dataset Description
To perform semantic segmentation, a labeled dataset is required, where each pixel in an image is annotated with a class label. Common datasets for semantic segmentation include:

PASCAL VOC: Contains 20 object classes and a background class.
COCO: Offers a more extensive set of classes and images.
Cityscapes: Focuses on urban scene understanding with classes such as roads, cars, pedestrians, etc.
Each dataset typically consists of:

Images: The raw images used for training and evaluation.
Masks: Corresponding to each image, a mask where each pixel is assigned a class label (e.g., road, building, sky).
Model Architecture
For semantic segmentation, several popular architectures are often used. The most common include:

Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)

Description: Converts traditional convolutional networks for dense prediction tasks by replacing fully connected layers with convolutional layers.
Output: Produces an output map of the same size as the input, where each pixel is classified.
U-Net

Description: Originally designed for biomedical image segmentation, U-Net consists of a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder) with skip connections.
Output: The model produces precise segmentation maps by combining high-resolution features from the encoder with the decoder.
DeepLabv3

Description: Combines dilated convolutions and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to capture multi-scale context in the image.
Output: Provides accurate segmentation maps with the ability to capture large contextual information.
Here, I will outline the process using a U-Net architecture for simplicity, but the steps apply similarly to other architectures.

Implementation Steps
Data Preprocessing

Image Normalization: Rescale pixel values to a range suitable for the neural network (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]).
Resize Images: Resize both images and masks to a consistent size (e.g., 256x256 pixels).
Data Augmentation: Apply transformations like rotations, flips, and color adjustments to increase the robustness of the model.
Model Architecture: U-Net

Encoder: Uses a series of convolutional and max-pooling layers to downsample the input image while capturing high-level features.
Decoder: Uses transposed convolutions (also known as deconvolutions) to upsample the feature maps back to the original image size.
Skip Connections: Directly connect corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder to retain spatial information.
Final Layer: A convolutional layer with a softmax activation to predict class probabilities for each pixel.
Loss Function

Cross-Entropy Loss: Commonly used when each pixel belongs to a single class.
Dice Loss: Often used in conjunction with cross-entropy, it is particularly effective for imbalanced datasets.
Optimizer

Adam: Adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm, which is widely used due to its efficiency.
Learning Rate Scheduler: Optionally apply a scheduler to reduce the learning rate as training progresses to fine-tune the model.
Training

Epochs and Batch Size: Train the model for a sufficient number of epochs with an appropriate batch size to ensure convergence.
Validation: Periodically validate the model on a separate validation set to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
Evaluation

Accuracy Metrics: Measure Intersection over Union (IoU), pixel accuracy, and mean IoU for evaluating model performance.
Visual Inspection: Compare predicted segmentation maps with ground truth to qualitatively assess the model.
